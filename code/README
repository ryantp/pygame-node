PROJECT: LOST SOUL

This is the source code for the Lost Soul (LS) game, written in Python3.5.1 (Anaconda3, 64-bit), with Pygame

LS is a 2-D Stealth / RTS game; scrolling map game;

!-- the first part of this README will cover information regarding the game, gameplay and content related to that
	the second part will discuss development of this project (mostly anecdotal)
	the third part will cover information related the actual code, extended documentation regarding the code, etc --

II.6 Anecdotes

	- The groupname DEV16 (while decent sounding, I guess) is simply the name of a folder on a desktop (which contains
		the ls/src directory).

######################## PART III

III.1 File and Folder Structure

	The File and Folder Structure (FFS) looks standard, main files occupying the root directory and subdirectories to help
organize the modules, images and data files. However, given the way this program is set up, the FFS tends to be a bit of a
headache (the other meaning of the FFS acronym is appropriate here :D). There is nothing outstanding about the subs [data,
backend, resources, levels]; the only `unique` looking one (for lack of a better term) is lsmods, which is just a subdir
for LS-specific modules, including the enemy and player modules.

III.2 Passing Variables

	Becasue another way of structuring this program hadn't exposed itself during development, this program relies HEAVILY on
passing variables and objects. While this may be perfectly normal, the amount of passing appears to be on the strong side,
particularly the passing of the same object to multiple functions and other objects (in this program, the
pygame.display.set_mode() object (herein named `screen`)).
