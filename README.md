# pygame-node

pygame-node; _a simple pygame framework for adding to areas which pygame doesn't address_

A collection of modules for streamlining the use of Pygame.

#IN-THE-QUEUE:
- `backend/dbsave.py` -- a portable module for creating and maintaining SQLite3 databases for projects
- `sprite.py` -- a script for sprite creation, including `Char`, `NPC`, `Enemy` and (eventually) `Obj` which can be called directly or subclassed.
- `menu.py` -- a module which will contain a menu class and other classes for animating menus
- `settings.py` -- a central file (not too dissimilar (in ideal) to Django's settings file, which will house info concerning meta-data and global settings

#IN-THE-FUTURE:
- Open GL support? "The world may never know o.o"
