# NOTES ON GRID FRAMEWORK MAPS

SYMBOLPOOL
	⌂ = continuous pattern
	∆ = alternates; alternating
	▫ = denotes x, y, z (in that order) points in a grid
	≈ = almost equal to
	== = equal to
	» = return

Basic Grid >
	floor outlines, denoting walls and obj's
	color code:
		black (line; box) = std; for standard walls, obj's etc
		dk_gray (line) = collapsable wall; only for walls, which would typically obscure the player character, it will fade to show the player's position
		blue (gateway) = indicates an open gateway, ie. door, gate, etc
		red (gateway) = indicates locked gateway, ie. door, gate, etc
		dk_red (gateway) = indicates SEALED_GATEWAY; does not unlock <NEEDED?>
		orange (circle; box) = switch, used to unlock red gateways
		green (line) = indicates explicit walkways, or traversable objects <NEEDED?>
		sky_blue (circle; box) = indicates a save point
		gold (circle) = breo stream
		yellow (circle; box) = life field

Objects:
	walls, beds, general_objects, cars, buildings, etc.

	walls = all inner-walls of buildings are objects
	doors = all doors / gates are objects; No intersecting with walls, will use a 'special wall instance', if needed
	beds = all objects which would be found in a building; obscure player's path
	general_objects = all trashcans, debris, etc.
	cars = all vehicles in roadways
	buildings = all non_enterable buildings; enterable buildings are a different class

ANGLE_DEGREE ≈ 40.0 degrees (a little less than 45 degrees)
APPROX_PIXEL_SLOPE = ⌂((1▫3)∆(1▫4))
