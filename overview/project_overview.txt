STORY:

    So a while back, I took an LOA from my job (still thankful to my managers for that ^^') in order to work on a project that I wanted to do: a (albeit simple) video game,
coded from scratch using Python. Admittedly an ambitious endeavor for a solo development project. Long story short, I didn't finish the project :P

    I finished the (vast majority) of the backend and was tooling around with how to approach level design when a number of factors added up and made me rethink using pygame
(mostly the issue of portability and unresolvable (at the time) glitches); I have decided to go with UE4 for finishing the actual project. However, that left this backend in
my directory sitting basically unused and I'm sure someone else can use this for something (if they so desired o.o).

    So I've went through and removed the hardcoding and tried to make it more portable, although a little tweaking may be required.
